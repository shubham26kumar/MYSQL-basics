    "Ans :- Data is nothing but information that is collected in various formats such as numbers, text, media, and others. In the context of computing, data can be converted into a binary digital form that enables flexibility to be moved around and processed efficiently. For example, pwskills can have data such as the name, age, and educational qualification of its students, details of the various courses it offers, etc.\n",
    "A database is a systematic or organized collection of related information that is stored in such a way that it can be easily accessed, retrieved, managed, and updated. It is where all data is stored, very much like a library that houses a wide range of books from different genres. Think of data as books.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a database, we can organize the data in rows and columns in the form of a table. Indexing the data makes it easy to find and retrieve it again as and when required. Many websites on the World Wide Web are managed with the help of databases. To create a database so that the data is accessible to users through only one set of software programs, database handlers are used.\n",

    "Ans :- DDL is used as an abbreviation for Data Definition Language. DDL refers to a computer language that is primarily used for creating as well as modifying the structure of the database objects present in a database. Such database objects include indexes, tables, schemas, views, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL is also referred to as a data description language in certain contexts since it describes the records and fields in the DB (database) tables.\n",
    "The current database industry basically incorporates DDL into the formal language that describes data. However, DDL is often considered a subset of Structured Query Language or SQL. Now, SQL often makes use of imperative verbs, along with normal English (like sentences) in order to implement database modifications. Thus, DDL doesn’t really show up to be a different language in the database of SQL, but it does define all the changes present in the DB schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mainly used to modify and establish the structure of the objects present in a database by dealing with the database schema descriptions. Unlike DML (data manipulation language) commands that we use for data modification, DDL commands are actually used to alter the structure of the database, like creating new objects or tables along with their attributes (table name, data type, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are commonly used in Data Definition Languages in SQL querying. Let’s discuss these in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE :-\n",
    "The CREATE command builds a new table. It has a predefined syntax, and the CREATE statement syntax goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE [name_of_table] ([definitions_of_column]) [parameters_of_table];\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Student (Student Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Name CHAR (50) NULL, Nickname CHAR (75) NOT NULL);\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the semi-colon used at the end of the statement is mandatory, and it is used to process every command before it. So, in the example mentioned above, we are trying to specify the data type using the string CHAR. Visit to learn more about the CREATE statement here. Various other data types are NUMBER, INTEGER or DATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP :-\n",
    "The DROP command is used in order to delete objects, like a table, view or index. We cannot rollback the DROP statement. Thus, once a certain object is destroyed, there would be no way at all to recover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the DROP statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP type_of_object name_of_object;\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Student;\n",
    "\n",
    "We have deleted the Employee table in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER :-\n",
    "The alter command modifies any existing table in a database. The Alter command can add up an additional column, drop the existing columns and even change the data types of various columns involved in a DB table. Read more on the ALTER command here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of an ALTER command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER type_of_object name_of_object parameters;\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Student ADD PRIMARY KEY (student_pk);\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have added the unique primary key to this table. It adds a constraint and enforces a unique value. Here, the constraint “student_pk” is the primary key, and it is on the Student table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE :-\n",
    "Just like the DROP statement, the TRUNCATE statement is mainly used to remove all the records from a table quickly. However, unlike the DROP statement that destroys a table completely, the TRUNCATE statement preserves the full structure so as to be reused later.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Student;\n",

    "Ans :- A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert), delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database. A DML is typically a sublanguage of a larger database language like SQL, with the DML containing some of the language’s operators. A DML (data manipulation language) is a group of computer languages that provide commands for manipulating data in databases.\n",
    "The majority of SQL statements are categorised as DML (Data Manipulation Language), which includes SQL commands that deal with modifying data in a database. It’s the section of the SQL statement that controls who has access to the database and data. DML statements and DCL statements are grouped together. Because the DML command isn’t auto-committed, it won’t be able to save all database changes permanently. There’s a chance they’ll be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some different DML commands:-\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT :-\n",
    "This command can be used to insert data into a row of a table. INSERT INTO would insert the values that are mentioned in the ‘Student’ table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "INSERT INTO NAME_OF_TABLE (1_column, 2_column, 3_column, …. N_column)\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUES (1_value, 2_value, 3_value, …. N_value);\n",
    "\n",
    "Or\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO NAME_OF_TABLE\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUES (1_value, 2_value, 3_value, …. N_value);\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "INSERT INTO Student(Stu_Name, DOB, Phone, Mail)\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUES(‘Phoebe’, ‘1998-05-26’, 7812865845, ‘user@xyz.com’);\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE :-\n",
    "This statement in SQL is used to update the data that is present in an existing table of a database. The UPDATE statement can be used to update single or multiple columns on the basis of our specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "UPDATE name_of_table SET 1_coumn = 1_value, 2_coumn = 2_value, 3_coumn = 3_value, … , N_coumn = N_value\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "And here,\n",
    "\n",
    "name_of_table: name of the table\n",
    "\n",
    "1_column, 2_column, 3_column, …. N_column: name of the first, second, third, …. nth column.\n",
    "\n",
    "1_value, 2_value, 3_value, …. N_value: the new value for the first, second, third, …. nth column.\n",
    "\n",
    "condition: the condition used to select those rows for which the column values need to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "UPDATE Student SET Phone = 9039462901 WHERE Stu_Name = ’Phoebe’;\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause in the preceding query is used to select the rows for which the columns need to be adjusted, and the SET statement has been used to assign new values to a particular column. If the WHERE clause is not used at all, then all of the rows’ columns will be modified. As a result, the WHERE clause is used to pick specific rows from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the example query would update the phone number of the student with the name ‘Phoebe’.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE :-\n",
    "The DELETE statement can be used in SQL to delete various records from a given table. On the basis of the condition that has been set in the WHERE clause, one can delete single or multiple records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "DELETE FROM Student WHERE Stu_Name = ’Phoebe’;\n",
    "\n",

    "Ans :- Primary Key :-\n",
    "A Primary Key is the minimal set of attributes of a table that has the task to uniquely identify the rows, or we can say the tuples of the given particular table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key of a relation is one of the possible candidate keys which the database designer thinks it's primary. It may be selected for convenience, performance and many other reasons. The choice of the possible primary key from the candidate keys depend upon the following conditions.\n",
    "Play Video\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimal: The primary key should be composed of the minimum number of attributes that satisfy unique occurrences of the tuples. So if one candidate key is formed using two attributes and another using a single attribute then the one with the single attribute key should be chosen as the primary key.\n",
    "Accessible: The primary key used should be accessible by anyone who wants to use it. The user must easily insert, access or delete a tuple using it.\n",
    "NON NULL Value: The primary key must have a non-null value for each tuple of the relation, which is required for the identification of the tuple.\n",
    "Time Variant: The values of the primary key must not change or become null during the time of a relation.\n",
    "Unique: The value of the primary key must not be duplicated in any of the tuples of a relation.\n",
    "Syntax for creating primary key constraint:\n",
    "The primary key constraint can be defined at the column level or table level.\n",
    "\n",

    "A foreign key is the one that is used to link two tables together via the primary key. It means the columns of one table points to the primary key attribute of the other table. It further means that if any attribute is set as a primary key attribute will work in another table as a foreign key attribute. But one should know that a foreign key has nothing to do with the primary key.\n",

A simple illustration of the cursor is when we have an extensive database of worker's records and want to calculate each worker's salary after deducting taxes and leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL Server cursor's purpose is to update the data row by row, change it, or perform calculations that are not possible when we retrieve all records at once. It's also useful for performing administrative tasks like SQL Server database backups in sequential order. Cursors are mainly used in the development, DBA, and ETL processes.\n",
